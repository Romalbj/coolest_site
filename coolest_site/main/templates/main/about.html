                    <h2>Hello, world</h2>
                    <p>I'm a 21 year old beginner web and python developer from Stavropol, Russia.
                        In my 3rd year at university, I realized that I didn’t like my specialty
                        at all and that I didn’t want to develop in the direction of economic security.
                        So I started immersing myself in the world of code and programming. I quickly
                        became fascinated by this activity and am passionate about learning programming.</p>

                    <h2>Just the beginning</h2>
                    <p>My journey in the IT field is just beginning. I've already
                        done several interesting projects and I'm not going to stop.
                        This site is my first step in learning web programming.
                        I completely immersed myself in creating the site, trying
                        to make it modern and beautiful. I hope I succeeded at least a little)).</p>

                    <h2>YouTube channel</h2>
                    <p>n my YouTube videos I often do things like
                        challenges, turning my viewers' drawings into
                        realistic versions, editing their photos, or
                        remaking posters from existing movies or shows.
                        Sometimes I turn myself into an existing fictional
                        character, often requested by viewers. Most of my
                        work is inspired by pop-culture and media. I love
                        movies and this is a big hobby of mine.</p>
